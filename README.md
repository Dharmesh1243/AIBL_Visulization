The dataset comprises longitudinal MRI data of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96, all right-handed, with each subject scanned at least once, resulting in 373 imaging sessions in total. Among the subjects, 72 were consistently categorized as 'Nondemented,' 64 as 'Demented' from their initial visits onwards, and 14 initially 'Nondemented' subjects later classified as 'Demented.' The clinical information includes MMSE scores, CDR ratings, and derived anatomic volumes like eTIV, nWBV, and ASF.

The MMSE, ranging from 0 to 30, assesses cognitive impairment, with scores below 24 indicating abnormality. The CDR, a 5-point scale, evaluates cognitive and functional performance, where 0 represents normalcy and higher scores signify various degrees of dementia severity. eTIV, indicative of intracranial volume, is essential for brain volumetric analyses, especially in neurodegenerative disease studies.

In summary, the dataset offers rich longitudinal MRI data alongside clinical assessments, providing valuable insights into cognitive impairment, dementia progression, and associated anatomical changes in aging subjects.
